# Controls and indicators

Display values and get user selections.

## Overview

OpenSwiftUI provides controls that enable user interaction specific to each platform and context. For example, people can initiate events with buttons and links, or choose among a set of discrete values with different kinds of pickers. You can also display information to the user with indicators like progress views and gauges.

Use these built-in controls and indicators when composing custom views, and style them to match the needs of your appâ€™s user interface. For design guidance, see [All components](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/components) in the Human Interface Guidelines.
