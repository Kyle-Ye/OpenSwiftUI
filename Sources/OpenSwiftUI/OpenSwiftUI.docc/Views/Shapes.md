# Shapes

Trace and fill built-in and custom shapes with a color, gradient, or other
pattern.

## Overview

Draw shapes like circles and rectangles, as well as custom paths that define
shapes of your own design. Apply styles that include environment-aware colors,
rich gradients, and material effects to the foreground, background, and outline
of your shapes.

If you need the efficiency or flexibility of immediate mode drawing — for
example, to create particle effects — use a ``Canvas`` view instead.
