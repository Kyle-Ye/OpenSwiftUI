# Drawing and graphics

Enhance your views with graphical effects and customized drawings.

## Overview

You create rich, dynamic user interfaces with the built-in views and
<doc:Shapes> that OpenSwiftUI provides. To enhance any view, you can apply many 
of the graphical effects typically associated with a graphics context, like
setting colors, adding masks, and creating composites.

When you need the flexibility of immediate mode drawing in a graphics context,
use a ``Canvas`` view. This can be particularly helpful when you want to draw an
extremely large number of dynamic shapes â€” for example, to create particle
effects.
