# Layout adjustments

Make fine adjustments to alignment, spacing, padding, and other layout
parameters.

## Overview

Layout containers like stacks and grids provide a great starting point for
arranging views in your appâ€™s user interface. When you need to make fine
adjustments, use layout view modifiers. You can adjust or constrain the size,
position, and alignment of a view. You can also add padding around a view, and
indicate how the view interacts with system-defined safe areas.

To get started with a basic layout, see <doc:Layout-Fundamentals>. For design
guidance, see [Layout](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/foundations/layout)
in the Human Interface Guidelines.
